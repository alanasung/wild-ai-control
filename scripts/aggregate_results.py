"""Collect every result JSON in the tree into one aggregate payload.

One command regenerates the aggregate, and the tables and figures are generated
from the aggregate rather than from whatever happened to be in someone's shell
history. That is the only way a results table stays consistent with the runs
behind it.

Two rules are enforced while collecting, both of which exist because the
alternative has burned real projects:

1. A file without ``task``, ``seed``, and ``git_sha`` is not a result. It is
   reported as a warning and excluded, rather than being folded in as an
   anonymous row nobody can trace.
2. Synthetic output is separated, never merged. A harness-validation payload and
   a measured payload look identical once they are rows in a table, so they are
   kept in different lists and the synthetic count is printed every time.

Usage:
    python scripts/aggregate_results.py
    python scripts/aggregate_results.py --search runs results --out results/results.json
    python scripts/aggregate_results.py --include-synthetic --strict
