"""Transparent logging wrapper for any LLM used inside the measurement instrument.

When an LLM grades, monitors, or simulates, it is part of the apparatus rather
than the subject. That makes its behaviour a methods-section fact, and reviewers
ask methods-section questions about it: which model version, what exactly was in
the prompt, how often did it get called, and did its outputs drift over the run.

None of those can be answered afterwards from a summary metric. They can only be
answered from a log written at call time, which is what this wrapper does: one
JSONL line per call holding the model version, the prompt, the response, the
elapsed time, and a UTC timestamp.

The wrapper is deliberately a thin :class:`~..evaluation.protocols.LLMBackend`
itself, so it can be dropped in wherever a bare callable was expected and
nothing downstream needs to know it is being recorded.
