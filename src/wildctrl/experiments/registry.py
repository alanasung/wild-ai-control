"""Stage registration and dependency-ordered execution planning.

A pipeline written as a sequence of function calls in ``main()`` encodes its
dependency order implicitly, in the order the lines happen to appear. That order
is invisible, unverifiable, and wrong the first time someone reorders two calls
that looked independent. The symptom is a stage silently consuming a stale
artifact from the previous run.

Declaring dependencies instead makes the order derivable and checkable. A cycle
becomes an error at planning time rather than a hang; a typo in a dependency
name becomes an error before any compute is spent; and asking for one stage
automatically pulls in what it needs.

The order is deterministic. Ties in the topological sort are broken
alphabetically rather than by dictionary insertion, so the plan does not change
because a module was imported in a different order.
