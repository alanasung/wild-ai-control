"""JSON and JSONL persistence for append-only run records.

JSONL is the format for anything a long run produces incrementally: LLM call
logs, per-example judgements, cache manifests. It has one property that matters
more than any other here -- a run killed at hour six leaves a file whose first
N lines are still valid, whereas a killed JSON array write leaves a file that
parses as nothing at all.

That property is only real if readers honour it, so :func:`read_jsonl` tolerates
a truncated final line by default. It counts what it skipped and logs a warning
rather than staying quiet, because "my file has 999 rows instead of 1000" is a
fact the reader has to know before averaging over it.

Whole-file JSON writes go through :func:`~..utils.run_manifest.write_json_atomic`
so the same crash cannot corrupt a results file. It is re-exported here so that
callers have one import for all persistence.
