"""Shared fixtures for the whole suite.

Three rules govern everything in ``tests/``:

1. **No weights are ever downloaded.** ``tiny_model`` builds a randomly
   initialised GPT-2 with 2 layers and a 32-dim residual stream from a config
   object, so it never touches the network. Anything that genuinely needs real
   weights is marked ``slow`` and deselected in CI.
2. **No test writes outside ``tmp_path``.** Run directories, caches, and result
   JSONs all live under a per-test temporary directory.
3. **Synthetic data used to validate the harness carries a planted answer.** The
   ``planted_failure_case`` fixture below is not random noise: it is constructed
   so that the correct output of the failure harness is known by hand, which is
   what makes it a test of the instrument rather than a smoke test.
